# THE13TH Intelligence Dashboard (frontend)

Install and build:

```bash
cd /home/hp/AIAutomationProjects/saas_demo/the13th/intelligence_dashboard
npm install
npm run build
```

The build copies the static files into `/home/hp/AIAutomationProjects/saas_demo/the13th/app_intelligence/dist` and the backend serves them at `/dashboard`.
